a:T57a,Cosmic reionization represents the latest phase transition in the Universe, when the Lyman-continuum photons turned the intergalactic medium from neutral to highly ionized. It has long been debated whether galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are the main source of the Lyman-continuum photons responsible for reionization. Previous observations slightly favoured galaxies as the main ionizing source. However, the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST) recently discovered an unexpectedly high density of AGN candidates at high redshift, which has largely enhanced the influence of AGNs. Here we derive a definitive upper bound on the AGN contribution to reionization using the latest JWST data and conclusively rule out AGNs as the dominant ionizing source during the peak epoch of reionization. We build a sample of galaxies and AGNs in a specific redshift range 7.15 ≤ z ≤ 7.75 with a high completeness. Each object is then decomposed into a point-source component and an extended component in their rest-frame far-ultraviolet JWST images. We assume all point-source components are AGNs. Our fiducial AGN sample reaches an unprecedentedly low luminosity of MUV ≈ −15 mag. Based on this sample, AGNs can contribute at most one third of the Lyman-continuum photonic budget required at z ≈ 7.5. Our result implies that galaxies dominate the ionizing source during the epoch of reionization.b:T786,@article{jiang2025f,

}c:T578,James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a new population of compact objects that show a unique V-shaped spectral energy distribution (SED) in the UV and optical wavelength range. These so-called “little red dots” (LRDs) often exhibit broad Balmer emission lines, indicative of the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). They generally lack detection of X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation, which is fundamentally different from typical AGNs. Various models, including super-Eddington-accreting black holes enshrouded in dense and dust-poor gas, have been proposed to explain these features. However, the nature of LRDs remains debated, and their evolutionary fate is unclear. Here we report two unusual LRDs at redshift z = 2.868 and 2.925 that are in a transitional phase towards typical AGNs. Their V-shaped SEDs, compact optical morphology, and broad emission lines satisfy the defining criteria of LRDs. On the other hand, they exhibit intense X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation that is much stronger than previously known LRDs. These hybrid properties suggest that the dense gas envelope around their central black holes is dispersing, allowing high-energy photons and radio emission to escape. Meanwhile, a dust torus is forming. This finding provides a direct insight into the nature of LRDs and indicates that at least some LRDs will evolve into AGNs or quasars at later times.d:T783,@misc{fu2025d,

}e:T5ba,The Fe II/Mg II emission line flux ratio in quasar spectra serves as a proxy for the relative Fe to α-element abundances in the broad-line regions of quasars. Due to the expected different enrichment timescales of the two elements, they can be used as a cosmic clock in the early Universe. We present a study of the Fe II/Mg II ratios in a sample of luminous quasars exploiting high-quality near-IR spectra taken primarily by the XQR-30 program with VLT XSHOOTER. These quasars have a median bolometric luminosity of log(Lbol[erg s−1]) ∼ 47.3 and cover a redshift range of z = 6.0–6.6. The median value of the measured Fe II/Mg II ratios is ∼7.9 with a normalized median absolute deviation of ∼2.2. In order to trace the cosmic evolution of Fe II/Mg II in an unbiased manner, we select two comparison samples of quasars with similar luminosities and high-quality spectra from the literature, one at intermediate redshifts (z = 3.5–4.8) and the other at low redshifts (z = 1.0–2.0). We perform the same spectral analysis for all these quasars, including the usage of the same iron template, the same spectral fitting method, and the same wavelength fitting windows. We find no significant redshift evolution in the Fe II/Mg II ratio over the wide redshift range from z = 1 to 6.6. The result is consistent with previous studies and supports the scenario of a rapid iron enrichment in the vicinity of accreting supermassive black holes at high redshift.f:T8a9,@article{jiang2024a,
